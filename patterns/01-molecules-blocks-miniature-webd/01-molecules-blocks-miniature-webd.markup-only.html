  <p>A paragraph (from the Greek paragraphos, "to write beside" or "written beside") is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax
    of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.</p>
